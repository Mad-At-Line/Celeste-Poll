# Celeste-Poll
The host of all the data and code going into the project: The More You Know The Less You're Sure: An Exploratory Study into the Relationship between Perceived and Actual Abilities. A huge thank you to the Celeste community for embracing this project and responding to our surveys en masse. 

If you want to run it should be rather simple just download the dataset provided in the "data" folder, replace the file path with your own filepath, install the dependancies, and run.
